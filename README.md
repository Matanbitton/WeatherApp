## About The Project

This is a weather app using the **[OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api)** 
Users can view the current weather and 5 day forecast of their desired city, all organazied in a simple and aesthetic UI.

I Pursued this project with the hopes of learning about asynchronous javascript and finding answers to a few questions I had in mind.

- JavaScript is a single threaded language. Ok, What does this mean? and what limitations that will impose on me as a developer?
- What is a callback?
- What is callback hell? and how do I avoid it?
- What is a Promise?
- What is async and await?

## What I learned:

- How promises help us avoid callback hell.

- The problem with only using promises. (unorganized code due to asynchronous code being diffuclt to read)

- How async and await help us view asynchronous code as synchronous code.

- How to make requests to an API and work with the data returned

- How to handle errors returned from API

## What I struggled with:

- Understanding JavaScripts event loop, that until I watched this video which I really recommend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&ab_channel=JSConf

- The concept of a "promise" of a future value, 
ok I assign this variable to be the result of this function, but I don't know when this function will finish executing what does this mean meanwhile for my variable?

## What I enjoyed:

- discovering that async and await are the best things since sliced bread.

- Working with API's can be really fun also there are a triliion of them online for free!
